	<b>IMPORTANT: for travel between Boston and Cambridge, please see the <span style="color: red">MBTA Red Line service interruption</span> note below, in the Public Transportation section.</b>
<h1>Getting to the event</h1>

<h2>By car</h2>

<p>
	Some parking will be available behind and next to the museum; more will be available on Beacon Street. Parking staff will be on site to direct and assist you. As always, Lyft and Uber are excellent alternatives.
</p>

<h2>By public transportation</h2>

<p>
	The Waterworks Museum is a ten-minute walk from three MBTA Green Line branches: D (at Reservoir), C (at Cleveland Circle), and B (at Chestnut Hill Ave.). D is fastest; B is slowest and best avoided at all costs.
</p>
<p>
	See the map of the area on the <a href="event.html">main event page</a>.
</p>

<h1>Coming from the airport</h1>

<h2>By car</h2>

<p>
	If you’re able to use Lyft or Uber, we recommend that. Follow signs to the designated pickup areas at each airport terminal for rideshares; the airport asks that you get to one of these locations <i>before</i> requesting the ride. We’ve used this approach on a few trips with no problems.
</p>
<p>
	If you’re renting a car, follow signs and/or ask at information booths to locate transportation to the rental agencies. Most likely you’ll board a shuttle bus.
</p>
<p>
	If you’re renting and you’ve never driven in Boston before, then good luck and may God have mercy on your soul.
</p>

<h2>By public transportation</h2>

<p>
	Taking public transportation is an option as well, but a little bit of a pain. Arriving at the airport, you’ll board the Silver Line (look for signs)—this is a special dedicated bus line that will take you under Boston Harbor into downtown to South Station, where you can transfer to the Red Line subway. If you’re staying at one of our arranged hotels, you’ll need to get off at Park Street and transfer to the Green Line westbound.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>For the Hotel Commonwealth:</b> take a B-, C-, or D-branch Green Line train westbound and get off at Kenmore. The hotel is pretty much right across the street from the station. You should be able to buy a card or ticket for future rides (see below) in the Kenmore station.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>For the Holiday Inn:</b> take a C-branch Green Line train westbound. The train will exit the tunnel after the Kenmore stop and become a streetcar running along Beacon St. Get off at St. Paul St., right at the entrance to the hotel (drivers and other passengers can usually help identify your stop, if you’re uncertain). <i>Please note that you can’t buy a transit ticket or card at streetcar stops!</i>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Boarding the Silver Line at the airport is free, and you can then transfer to the Red and Green Lines for free as well, if you don’t leave the subway area.  However, if you’re staying here and anticipate using the T again, you might want to buy a CharlieTicket at South Station as you pass through, and you might have to leave the subway area to get to the fare vending machines, requiring you to use the ticket you just purchased to get back in. See below for more info.
<p>
	See also the area map on the <a href="event.html">main event page</a>, and general information about the MBTA below.
</p>

<h1>Getting back to the airport</h1>

<h2>By car</h2>

<p>
	Drive at your own risk! Lyft and Uber are, again, great options.
</p>

<h2>By public transportation</h2>

<p>
	For public transportation, take the subway to South Station on the Red Line; there you can transfer directly to the Silver Line bus. Make sure you get on an SL1 bus to Logan Airport. The Silver Line will take you directly to your terminal.
</p>

<h1>Public transportation in Boston in general</h1>

<p>
	Boston’s public transit service is the <a href="https://mbta.com">MBTA</a>; the subway/streetcar system is known as “the T.” Full details about all aspects of the system can be found on their <a href="https://mbta.com">web site</a>, but here are some key points.
</p>
<div class="warning">
	<p>
		<b style="color: red">MBTA Red Line service interruption between Boston and Cambridge:</b> If you’re planning to travel between Boston and Cambridge over the weekend, especially if you’re staying in Cambridge, please note that on Saturday and Sunday the train will not be running between Kendall and Park St. Stations, due to ongoing reconstruction of the main bridge over the river.  The MBTA will be providing shuttle buses between those stops.
	</p>
	<p>
		Please leave generous amounts of extra time in your travel plans to account for the resulting delays!  And we’re sorry, on behalf of Boston.
	</p>
	<p>
		(If you need help navigating the Boston transit system, they generally do a good job directing people to and from the shuttle buses in these situations. Look for signs, and for MBTA staffers who can help guide you.)
	</p>
	<p>
		Service on Friday should be normal.
	</p>
</div>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Hours:</b> Boston is a bit parochial, and the T shuts down around 12:30 a.m. If you’re likely to be out later than that (we won’t), be prepared for that.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Lines:</b> The subway/streetcar system has four colored lines. The wedding locations are on various branches of the Green Line, which is often slow—the D line is best, and the B line is the worst. You might also use the Red Line, which intersects with the Green Line at Park Street Station on the Boston Common, a great starting point for downtown explorations. The Silver Line is a dedicated bus rather than a subway, useful mainly for getting to and from the airport.
	<li>
		<b>Fares:</b> Fares are mostly electronic. You can pay with a reusable plastic “<a href="https://mbta.com/fares/charliecard">CharlieCard</a>” a paper “<a href="https://mbta.com/fares/charlieticket">CharlieTicket</a>,” or cash (not recommended). With both the CharlieTicket and the CharlieCard, you pay to put money on the card or ticket in advance. There are fare machines inside most underground stations, but not generally at streetcar stops. The machines are touch-screen operated and fairly easy to figure out; major stops have actual humans who can help you if necessary.
		<div class="linespace">&nbsp;</div>
		Travel by CharlieCard is slightly cheaper, but you have to go further out of your way to get one. CharlieTickets can be bought from automated machines in many stations. The CharlieTicket is often better for visitors in spite of the higher cost per ride.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Buses:</b> The MBTA includes a large network of bus lines, but negotiating them is sometimes challenging even for locals. We recommend sticking to the T for most purposes.
	<li>
		<b>Passes:</b> If you’re staying longer or plan to explore, you might want to look into the <a href="https://mbta.com/fares">1-day and 7-day unlimited-ride passes</a> available.
	</li>
</ul>
