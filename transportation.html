<h1>Getting to the wedding</h1>

<h2>By Public Transportation:</h2>
<p>
	The Waterworks Museum is a ten-minute walk from three MBTA Green Line branches: D (at Reservoir), C (at Cleveland Circle), and B (at Chestnut Hill Ave.). D is fastest; B is slowest and best avoided at all costs.
</p>


<h2>By Car:</h2>
<p>
	Very limited parking will be available behind the museum; more will be available along Beacon St. Parking staff will be on site to direct and assist you. As always, Lyft and Uber are excellent alternatives.
