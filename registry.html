	Okay, look, people, here’s the deal. We’re in our 40s. We’re not setting up a house. We have everything we need, and an awful lot of the things we want. We are very, very lucky to be where we are in life, and asking for more just seems gross.  So we haven’t registered anywhere.

	Instead, if you feel moved to make a gift, we would be deeply honored and grateful if you would make it in the form of a donation to a cause that we value. Here are links to some of the organizations we most strongly support&mdash;this is our registry.
