<p>
	Okay, look, people, here’s the deal. We’re in our 40s. We’re not setting up a house. We have everything we need, and an awful lot of the things we want. We are very, very lucky to be where we are in life, and asking for more just seems gross.  So we haven’t registered anywhere.
</p>
<p>
	Instead, if you feel moved to make a gift, we would be deeply honored and grateful if you would make it in the form of a donation to a cause that we value. Below are links to some of the organizations that are meaningful to us and that we support. Please choose whichever ones speak to you, and consider that our registry.
</p>

<h1>Recipe collection</h1>
<p>
	We are asking for one thing, though. One of Rebecca’s hopes and dreams would be to receive one or two favorite recipes from each guest that could start her new family cookbook. Please consider <a href="contact.html">emailing</a> or snail-mailing* your recipe to Rebecca, or bringing it to the wedding. It can be for the stove, oven, grill, slow cooker, Instant Pot, or convection oven — she has all the gadgets!  (See what we mean?)
