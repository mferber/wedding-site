			What are all those weird drawings on all your wedding things?
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="faq-a">
		<p>
			They’re illustrations by Edward Gorey (1925–2000), a prolific, beloved writer and illustrator from Cape Cod who had a unique talent for strange, whimsical, and macabre works. He’s best known for <i>The Gashlycrumb Tinies</i>, in which 26 alphabetically named children meet unfortunate fates in rhyming couplets, and for the opening credits of PBS’s long-lived show, <i>Mystery!</i>

			So, those weird animals with the speech bubbles on the invitation?

	</div>
	<div class="faq-a">
		<p>
			Those are excerpts from one of Gorey’s most inscrutable works, <em>The Nursery Frieze</em> (this is not a hint of any kind, by the way). Nobody is sure what the animals are supposed to be. They’re frequently described as &#8220;hippopotamus-like.&#8221; One commenter on the Internet declared them to be capybaras, but they’re clearly not.

			Okay, but so what does any of this have to do with your wedding, though?
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="faq-a">
		<p>
			Therein lies a tale. Last summer, on the way out to Cape Cod with a little extra time to kill, we stopped at the town of Yarmouth Port so Matthias could show Rebecca <a href="http://www.wickedlocal.com/x1342178056/Big-is-beautiful-Yarmouth-Port-tree-in-history-and-legend">a really remarkable tree</a>. There aren’t many trees around that are worth going out of your way for, but trust us, this one is.
		</p>
		<p>
			The tree is behind an old sea captain’s house that you can tour, and across the street from that house, we discovered, is the house where Edward Gorey lived and worked. It’s now <a href="http://www.edwardgoreyhouse.org/">a museum of his life and art</a>. We went back the next day, when we had more time available, and were blown away. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/travel/the-edward-gorey-house-on-cape-cod-is-the-good-kind-of-ghastly/2017/07/11/b3947db4-4250-11e7-adba-394ee67a7582_story.html?utm_term=.57c9da7e1d63">It’s a wonderful place</a>, suffused with the whimsy, wit, and weirdness that fills Gorey’s work, and evidence of a personality to match. It’s decorated with his personal collections; the walls are adorned with his illustrations and framed articles about him. There’s an amazing collection of envelopes drawn by students in Gorey’s style for an annual contest.
		</p>
		<p>
			Best of all, there’s a scavenger hunt: all 26 of the Gashlycrumb Tinies are represented somewhere in the house, and the task is to find them all. (Watch out for the tour guide who desperately wants to tell you where they all are before you have a chance to find them yourself!) The museum instantly became one of our favorite places.
		</p>
		<p>
			What neither of us knew that day, though, was that the location would soon become even more important to us. A week later, Matthias proposed to Rebecca beneath the branches of that really cool tree. And so it just seemed natural to adopt Gorey as the patron saint of our wedding.
