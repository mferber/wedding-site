<h1>When</h1>

<p>Doors will open at 5:30 p.m.  The wedding will start at 6:00.</p>

<h1>Attire &amp; format</h1>

<p>The reception will be “cocktail-style”—no fixed seating, with passed <i>hors d’oeuvres</i> and food stations. Comfortable footwear is strongly recommended!</p>

<p>Attire is “dressy casual.” We’re interpreting that as “Dress up a little, but be comfortable.” Some rough guidelines:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<i>Men:</i> Slacks (or nice jeans) and a nice button-down shirt are good. Jacket and tie are both optional but certainly appropriate. You should feel free to wear a suit if you feel like it!
	</li>
	<li>
		<i>Women:</i> A nice shirt, dress pants (or nice jeans), or skirt, or a cocktail dress.
	</li>
</ul>
