	Some suggestions for things to do if you're new in town:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Events:</b> See this <a href="https://www.events12.com/boston/">calendar of local events</a> for things to do this month: everything from theater to film festivals to beer tastings to sheep shearings.
	<li>
		<b>Take a guided walking tour:</b> we recommend the excellent <a href="http://www.bostonbyfoot.org">Boston by Foot</a> (<a href="http://www.bostonbyfoot.org/calendar-node-field-date-pm">calendar</a>).
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Take a guided driving tour:</b> The original <a href="http://www.bostonducktours.com">Duck Tour</a> is fun; you're on an amphibious vehicle that takes you around town and then onto the Charles River.  The <a href="https://www.trolleytours.com/boston">Old Town Trolley Tour</a> is a ubiquitous hop-on-hop-off trolley that can be a good way to cover a lot of sightseeing territory.  If you’re into the macabre, Rebecca’s particular favorite is the nighttime <a href="https://www.ghostsandgravestones.com/boston">Ghosts &amp; Gravestones</a> trolley tour.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Go for a walk on your own:</b> Boston is a great walking city.  There’s a very good list of suggested walks <a href="https://fitt.co/boston/walks-take-boston/">here</a>. There are also some fascinating graveyards, mostly included on the Freedom Trail.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Eat pasta:</b> The North End is a fantastic place to eat if you like Italian food.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Swan boats:</b> Take a ride on the historic <a href="https://swanboats.com">swan boats</a> in the Public Garden.  Most fun for small children, might include a long wait.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Baseball:</b> Go to a <a href="https://www.mlb.com/redsox/schedule/2018-04?mlbkw=ds-g-p28905413301&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIwsix2My82gIVSlcNCh3_OgYkEAAYASABEgJ9avD_BwE">Red Sox game</a> at Fenway Park (Sox vs. Tampa Bay Rays, 1:05 p.m. on Sunday — <a href="https://mpv.tickets.com/?agency=MLB_MPV&orgid=23&pid=8523220&tfl=Boston_Red_Sox-Schedule-Boston_Red_Sox:_Schedule:_Schedule-na-x0-Desktop-Landscape#/event/8523220/ticketlist/?view=sections&minPrice=10&maxPrice=650&quantity=2&sort=price_desc&ada=false&seatSelection=false&onlyCoupon=true">buy tickets</a>).

	<li>
		<b>Visit <a href="https://www.mass.gov/locations/castle-island-pleasure-bay-m-street-beach-and-carson-beach">Castle Island</a> (not an island):</b> tour Fort Independence, one of the oldest continuously fortified sites in the United States. Take out some food at Sullivan’s.  Enjoy beautiful views of Boston Harbor and watch planes take off from Logan, or walk the two-mile loop around Pleasure Bay.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Art museums:</b> Visit the <a href="http://www.mfa.org">Museum of Fine Arts</a> (current exhibitions include M. C. Escher and Mark Rothko), or its more interesting smaller sibling, the <a href="https://www.gardnermuseum.org">Isabella Stewart Gardner museum</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Other museums:</b> Visit the terrific <a href="https://mos.org">Boston Museum of Science</a>, which has an excellent domed <a href="https://mos.org/imax">Omni IMAX Theater</a> and <a href="https://mos.org/4d">"4D" theater</a> in addition to the exhibit halls.  See the <a href="http://www.neaq.org/exhibit/giant-ocean-tank/">Giant Ocean Tank</a> at the <a href="http://www.neaq.org">New England Aquarium</a>.  Or come back to the Waterworks Museum and see all the exhibits you missed at the wedding!
