	<a href="https://waterworksmuseum.org">The Waterworks Museum</a> is the former pumping station for the City of Boston, when the city was served by the Chestnut Hill Reservoir. Designed by City Architect Arthur Vinal in the Richardsonian Romanesque style, and known as the “Tabernacle of Steam” due to its similarity to Richardson’s iconic Trinity Church in Copley Square, it was in continuous operation from 1887 until the 1970s, when the Quabbin Reservoir, in western Massachusetts, came online. It became a museum in 2009.

	It was discovered by us in November 2013, the day Rebecca moved into an apartment across the Reservoir. We didn’t get around to actually going there until 2017, when Rebecca was on the verge of leaving the neighborhood to move in with Matthias, but we fell instantly in love with it, and we think you’ll see why. When we needed a place to hold a wedding, it was the first thing we thought of, and we’re very excited to be holding our special occasion there.
