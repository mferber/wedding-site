	<a href="https://waterworksmuseum.org">The Waterworks Museum</a> is the former High Service Pumping Station for the City of Boston, when the city’s water was provided by the Chestnut Hill Reservoir.  It pumped water to communities at a higher altitude. (The Low Service Pumping Station is next door.)

	Designed by City Architect Arthur Vinal in the Richardsonian Romanesque style, and expanded ten years later by Boston’s last City Architect, Edmund M. Wheelwright, it was known as the “Tabernacle of Steam” due to its similarity to Richardson’s iconic Trinity Church in Copley Square. It was in operation from 1887 until the 1970s, when the Quabbin Reservoir, in western Massachusetts, came online. After that it fell into disrepair for many years, until it was rescued by concerned citizens. It was converted into condominiums and a museum in 2009, and it’s one of Boston’s least-known treasures.

	It was discovered by us in November 2013, the day Rebecca moved into an apartment across the Reservoir. We didn’t get around to actually going there until 2017, when Rebecca was about to move out, but we immediately fell in love with it, and we think you’ll see why. When we needed a place to hold a wedding, it was the first thing we thought of, and we’re very excited to be holding our special occasion there.
